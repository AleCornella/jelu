It's appalling how many of the things in the book remind me of the various events that took place in the past decade, especially in the US. <br/><br/>Thinking back on the ending, I especially like it because it avoids being both a clichéd happy-end and its polar opposite. It's both bleak and hopeful, but also quite sudden; a story suddenly cut off. This reinforces its ""found diary"" quality.",,,1,0

This is especially true about the whole first part (called Contemplation, or Betrachtung in German) and the four stories united under the theme of a starving artist: A Hunger Artist (Ein Hungerkünstler), A Little Woman (Eine kleine Frau), Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk or Josefine (die Sängerin, oder Das Volk der Mäuse), and First Sorrow (Erstes Leid).<br/><br/>It should come as no surprise, then, that I like Kafka's more narrative-driven works better. In this collection, that would be:<br/><br/>(longer ones)<br/>* In the Penal Colony (In der Strafkolonie)<br/>* The Metamorphosis (Die Verwandlung)<br/>* The Stoker (Der Heizer)<br/>(shorter ones)<br/>* Before the Law (Vor dem Gesetz, amazing!)<br/>* The Dream (Ein Traum)<br/>* The Bucket Rider (Der Kübelreiter)",,,1,0
